<h3>Is there any massage?</h3>

<p>We will have sore, tired muscles at times and we will spend many evenings working on each other.  Any form of massage is a field of study in and of itself.  It is not a requirement that you already practice some form of massage and it’s totally up to you wether or not to include it in your teaching.

<h3>Do I need to be a teacher already to join?</h3>

<p>No, however having teaching/leadership skills will obviously be a huge help, these will be some of the skills we develop and work on over the month.  If you don’t teach something already we strongly suggest that you start teaching friends something basic, yoga, whatever acro you know already, any practice that you have.
