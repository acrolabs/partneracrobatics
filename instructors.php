<h1>Instructors</h1>
<p>
<b>Emily Baxter, Niko Douwes and Lorenzo Becchi</b>  will be the main teachers on this training.
</p>
<p>
We are passionate about sharing our love for partner acrobatics.  The practice brings us so much joy we want to spread that far and wide.   We aim to give you new perspectives, support you in dropping fears and break through any limitations you may have in your body or mind.
</p>
<p>
Our intention is to train, practice and play with you, presenting and teaching you new things in the realm of partner and group work. 
</p>
<p>
In the teacher training we will discuss leadership skills, explore the qualities that make a good teacher, experiment with different ways of explaining things, and how to appeal to various styles of learners.  We will study how to break things down and work with progressions.   
Ultimately we want you to develop your own style of teaching, doing what works for you and your students.

<img src="img/lorenzo_becchi.jpg" width="250px" align="right">

<a name="lorenzo"></a><b>Lorenzo</b> has long been a practitioner of yoga and Chinese martial arts. These practices led him to discover the world of alternative therapies, which then became his passion.

After studying Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture in Barcelona, Spain, Lorenzo deepened his studies into the world of energetic and emotional therapies. EFT (Emotional Freedom Techniques), NLP (Neuro-Linguisitic Programming) and Craniosacral Biodynamics are now part of his practice. He believes in the value of gentle techniques that allow the client to become aware of the causes underlying any imbalances, in order to acknowledge and release them.<br>
At the same time, Lorenzo's love for bodywork took him to investigate the art of Thai Massage and expand his views into <a href="http://flyingtherapeutics.org" target="_blank">Flying Therapeutics</a>, an inversion therapy that brings people into a weightless, deep and pleasant connection with the inner child.
</p>
<p>As an acrobat Lorenzo loves ground partner acrobatics, fast spinning washing machines and elegant transitions.</p>
